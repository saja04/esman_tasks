###### **WARNING**ðŸ”´

==These scripts are still in development and they should not be used until their final version is complete.==

==These scripts are not meant to be runned with .NET runtime any under circumstances. The only reason why there's a .csproj is because of the VSC local linting, nothing more. Again, DO NOT TRY TO RUN THE CODE (run in Streamer.bot).==

## **Esman Tasks**

Esman Tasks is for those Study Streamers who want to give a more interactive experience for all their viewers inside their Twitch streamings.

#### What do Esman Tasks do?

Esman Tasks gives your twitch viewers the possibility to create personal study/work tasks for them to achieve their goals and mark up their progress along yours, in an interactive way. You can show the tasks progress in your stream, for everyone to interact with the other's progress and make sense of progression among them.

  

#### How it works?

The first time one of your viewers uses a task command, the scripts are going to create a .txt file with their twitch id as a name, where all their information is going to be stored. All the tasks they create are going to be stored in that file and two other .txt files (one directory up) which are dedicated to show all the tasks information in the layout/scene.
These scripts use only C# standard library and are not, under any circumstance, going to send any kind of information to a third party. This is guaranteed since anyone can check the scripts code to make sure there's no back door or anything suspicios that the scripts are doing.

#### "Installation"

(this installation guide assumes you already have Streamer.bot downloaded and have made some basic commands with it, after configuring it for you channel and your stream app).

  

Here you do not install anything. The only thing you need to do is create actions for each script, let me tell you how:

- First let's create an action for each command. You can name them as the command that they are going to execute (eg. !taskdone command action could be name as the command itself: !taskdone).

- These actions triggers are going to be Core Commands (Command Triggered), the command to use is up to you, but I recommend you use the same as each script name, with the "!" on the beggining (eg. the taskdone script command could be just !taskdone).

- What the actions are going to do is always execute the script (the code inside each script in this repository) with the C# code compiler inside Streamer.bot. To do this, go to the Sub-Action section, right click -> Core -> C# ->Execute C# Code. A window is going to pop up showing a template C# function, so just delete everything inside of it and paste the whole code for that command of the selected script from this repository.

- Make sure that you save each script inside the Sub-Action by clicking "Save and Compile" bellow after pasting the code. Also you want to go to Settings and check the "Precompile on Application Start" option.

%% - Â  Â TODO ADD CONFIG STEPS FOR THE SCENE Â CHANGES %% Â 

After you created all the actions for each script, it is crucial that you run the startercommand just once and then disable it. This script will create all the necessary files and directories for the scripts to run (this is to not having to check it every time a script is runned).

Just repeat the process for all the necessary scripts and test it to make sure everything works just fine and let your viewers know of your new implementation!

  

### To Do

- [X] delete task description, datecompleted and completed from all scripts.

- [X] task names should be able to contain spaces.

- [X] !taskdone should show how long that task took to complete, instead of the DateAdded and DateCompleted. 

- [X] Make the layout in 2 files, one with the completed tasks and the other one with the created tasks. They will not have a limit, but the createdTasks file must delete the first found task once someone completes it.

- [X] !task script should add the task to the TasksInQueue tasklists inside tasksLayout.txt.

- [X] Create the taskdeleter, which should erase the tasks in the layout and all users tasks. This script should execute every 24 hours or at will through a !tasksclean (only for mods and broadcaster).

- [ ] Make a script that creates all necessary files and directories for the scripts to run perfectly. //CURRENT

- [ ] Make the scene for the layout to show.
    - [ ] First make the HTML template.
        - [ ] HTML template should have the script to fetch the text from the necessary .txt files.
        - [ ] HTML template should have styles and animations for when tasks get added or completed. This can be done by creating the first task of each group as a custom class < p > inside the template.
    - [ ] Then the task, taskdone, taskdelete commands should update the web source via "CPH.SlobsSetBrowserSource(scene, source, url);" method. This means that the commands are going to update the HTML template directly (lots of work i think)

<!-- - [ ] Add focus command (viewer can send !startfocus to save the focusTimeStarted and then !stopfocus to return how much he was on focus [returns currentDate - focusTimeStarted]). This could have a counter for the top-time-focus viewers. -->
