#### To Do
- [X] delete task description, datecompleted and completed from all scripts.
- [X] task names should be able to contain spaces.
- [X] !taskdone should show how long that task took to complete, instead of the DateAdded and DateCompleted.
- [ ] !task script should add the task to the TasksInQueue tasklists inside tasksLayout.txt. //CURRENT 
- [ ] Create the taskdeleter, which should erase the tasks in the layout and all users tasks. This script should execute every 24 hours or at will through a !tasksclean (only for mods and broadcaster).
- [ ] Make the scene for the layout to show.
<!-- - [ ] Add focus command (viewer can send !startfocus to save the focusTimeStarted and then !stopfocus to return how much he was on focus [returns currentDate - focusTimeStarted]). This could have a counter for the top-time-focus viewers. -->
